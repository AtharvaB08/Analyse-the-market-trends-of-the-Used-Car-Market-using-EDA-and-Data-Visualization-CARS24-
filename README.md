# Cars24 Data Distribution Dashboard 📊

## Project Overview
This project presents a Tableau dashboard for analyzing **Cars24** car distribution data. It highlights key insights such as average car price by manufacturer, fuel types, city-wise price ranges, and distance traveled relative to price. 

The dashboard serves as a valuable tool for understanding car market dynamics, including:
- Manufacturer-specific trends
- Transmission and fuel type distributions
- Travel distance vs. price insights
- Geographical analysis of car price ranges across cities
